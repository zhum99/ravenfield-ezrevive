Downs actors under a certain threshold of health by constantly damaging their balance damage, causes immersive procedural writhing on the ground.
Assigns medic behaviour to actors spawning with a designated range of items (user-set)
Checks periodically for downed actors in a radius around a medic-designated actor, upon find kicks them from their squad (to allow for independent pathing)
Medics near a downed actor that they have chosen to revive cause the downed actor's health to rise, eventually pausing the balance damage once their health crests the threshold, allowing them to get back up.
